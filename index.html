                <article>
                    <p>I am an adjunct research professor at UNC Chapel Hill. Most of my work involves advanced calculations
                        and visualizations that help further the understanding of the interior of the Earth. If you think
                        this sounds too technical and boring, you'd be surprised to know that my work also involves travelling
                        to places and doing fieldwork out in the wilderness where no man has ever set a foot (like Antarctica
                        for instance...). Yes, some may think this is way too cool, but nothing comes for free. The fieldwork
                        part of my job requires me to carry out some laborious tasks such as diging 6 feet deep holes in
                        the ground, mixing and pouring concrete and carrying 80 lbs concrtete bags up the mountains...But
                        it is totally worth it! :)
                    </p>
                    <p>Aside from work, I recently became a father. I have a 1 year old daughter, whose growth (both mental
                        and physical) amazes me everyday. I love spending time with her and playing games. I have never imagined
                        I would enjoy playing pick-a-boo as a grown man this much...In addition to the passion for my family,
                        I am also consumed with computer programming and coding. Infact, I feel that coding is the best part
                        of my current work (even better than fieldwork!!!). This is the sole reason for my decision to take
                        some important steps towards learning web development and starting my journey towards a career in
                        coding.
